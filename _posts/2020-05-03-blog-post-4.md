Since the beginning of the national emergency due to the advance of Covid19, in Peru, as in other countries, it has been urgent to serve populations that, given their characteristics, are more vulnerable than others: the poor. Conventionally, one way to identify these people is through monetary measurements, which evaluate households through their spending: if given their income they cannot consume a minimum basket, they are poor, otherwise they are not. Although this approach allows the construction of indicators that have a simple measurement and understanding, there are currently several studies that indicate that "purchasing behavior is only part of the defining characteristic of poverty". In this framework, I propose to offer some reasons to start measuring poverty from a multidimensional plane.

As stated in the previous article, a very important characteristic of the poor is the fact of having informal employment (93.1% of the working-age poor who are employed are informal). With a greater disaggregation, it is observed that informality is almost total in the quintiles with the lowest labor income (98.9% in the first quintile). However, it should be noted that even in the highest income quintiles there are informal jobs (30.8% in the fifth quintile).

Spatially, workers with informal jobs are located mainly in rural areas and have a higher incidence in the Andes and jungle regions. Regarding the geographical scope, a higher informal employment rate is observed in rural areas (95.6%) compared to urban areas (65.7%). The geographic domains with the highest informal employment rates are Sierra Norte (87.9%), Sierra Centro (85.4%) and Selva (84.8%).

Although informality is seen as an indicator of job quality from the demand side (low qualification and absence of labor benefits), it is also closely related to an indicator from the labor supply side: underemployment (labor income and insufficient hours worked) which can be understood as an indicator of worker job satisfaction. In particular, 83.4% of the underemployed by income (invisible underemployment) and 95.8% of the underemployed by insufficient hours (visible underemployment) are informal workers.

Informal workers are mostly concentrated in less productive and labor-intensive economic sectors, they are mainly workers who work within households and work in small companies. In particular, the Agriculture, Home and Forestry sectors (85.6%); Transportation (85.6%) and Commerce; and, Construction (74%) employ more informal workers. By occupational category, the highest informality is found in unpaid family workers (100%, by definition), domestic workers (91.9%) and independent workers (89.3%). Regarding the size of the companies, it is observed that the highest levels of informality are found in the smallest companies: up to 20 workers (87.8%) and 21 to 50 workers (44.6%).

As in the case of the poor, informal workers have several characteristics that make them more vulnerable to the lack of economic activities since, by definition, they do not have any labor benefits nor will their employers continue to pay them a salary. Loayza (2008) points out that informality in employment in Peru does not have a single cause, but is a product of the combination of poor public services and a regulatory framework that does not allow formalization.

Throughout these two articles I have tried to provide more information on who will be most affected in the short term by the crisis caused by Covid19, but I have noticed that we were already in a deep crisis before the virus arrived: that of structural exclusion. Although it is important to attend to the present and its urgent needs, it is important not to lose sight of the problems that we have been dragging for many years. If today as a country it is so difficult for us to keep the population in their homes due to the risk of contagion, we should also try to understand that those who do so are often forced by great need. Today it is known that the government aid has not yet reached all those who need it most because there is a great problem of targeting and locating these people and also of the common leaks. Unfortunately, the existence of a small state has been added, with poor public services for poor people. We have much to do.
