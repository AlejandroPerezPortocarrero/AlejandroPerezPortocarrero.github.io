Since the beginning of the national emergency due to the advance of Covid19, in Peru, as in other countries, it has been urgent to serve populations that, given their characteristics, are more vulnerable than others: the poor. Conventionally, one way to identify these people is through monetary measurements, which evaluate households through their spending: if given their income they cannot consume a minimum basket[^1], they are poor, otherwise they are not. Although this approach allows the construction of indicators that have a simple measurement and understanding, there are currently several studies that indicate that "purchasing behavior is only part of the defining characteristic of poverty"[^2]. In this framework, I propose to offer some reasons to start measuring poverty from a multidimensional plane[^3].

[^1]: According to INEI (2019), the monetary approach considers people in households whose per capita spending is insufficient to acquire a basic basket of food and non-food (housing, clothing, education, health, transportation, etc.) to be poor. Likewise, those from households whose per capita expenses are below even the cost of the basic food basket are extremely poor.

[^2]: See for example the paper by Caterina Ruggeri et al. (2003) *“Does it matter that we do not agree on the definition of poverty? A comparison of four approaches”* showing an example for Peru and India.

[^3]: These reasons are based on the first chapter of the book *Multidimensional poverty measurement and analysis* by Sabina Alkire et al. (2015).
