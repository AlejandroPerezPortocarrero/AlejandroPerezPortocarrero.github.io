Since the beginning of the national emergency due to the advance of Covid19, in Peru, as in other countries, it has been urgent to serve populations that, given their characteristics, are more vulnerable than others: the poor. Conventionally, one way to identify these people is through monetary measurements, which evaluate households through their spending: if given their income they cannot consume a minimum basket[^1], they are poor, otherwise they are not. Although this approach allows the construction of indicators that have a simple measurement and understanding, there are currently several studies that indicate that "purchasing behavior is only part of the defining characteristic of poverty"[^2]. In this framework, I propose to offer some reasons to start measuring poverty from a multidimensional plane[^3].

Let us start by saying that today there is a global recognition of the importance of having a comprehensive measure of multidimensional poverty that captures the multiple deprivations faced by the poor and that provides information on the intensity and composition of poverty. Here it should be clarified that multidimensional measures are not contrary to traditional monetary measurements, but rather seek to complement them by reflecting relevant aspects of poverty that can hardly be tracked using only one-dimensional variables such as consumption or income.

The first reason for having a multidimensional measure of poverty is empirical: monetary poverty is not a good proxy for the most important non-monetary deprivations. To illustrate this, let's take the [example](http://blog.pucp.edu.pe/blog/idhal/2020/04/19/covid-19-y-pobreza-multidimensional-en-el-peru/) that the PUCP Institute for Human Development in Latin America (IDHAL) made taking as reference a bulletin recently published by the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI), one of the main institutions focused on calculation of multidimensional poverty worldwide. The IDHAL has carried out some calculations to identify the Peruvian population that, based on certain deficiencies that they suffer in various dimensions of their well-being, could be at greater risk due to the advance of Covid19 and compared them with the figures of monetary poverty in the country to assess whether these measures are consistent.

[^1]: According to INEI (2019), the monetary approach considers people in households whose per capita spending is insufficient to acquire a basic basket of food and non-food (housing, clothing, education, health, transportation, etc.) to be poor. Likewise, those from households whose per capita expenses are below even the cost of the basic food basket are extremely poor.
